                A monumental engineering project undertaken during my time at E3D, this custom-built FDM 3D printer boasts an overall footprint of 2m x 2m x 3m and a massive 1.2m square build area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary objective was to create a high-performance, large-format machine capable of producing substantial parts with precision and reliability. This build pushed the boundaries of my understanding of 3D printer mechanics, advanced electronics integration, firmware configuration, and large-scale system design. It was a complex and rewarding challenge, culminating in a truly unique piece of additive manufacturing hardware.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mt-8">Engineering Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Building a printer of this scale presented numerous unique challenges. Ensuring frame rigidity across a 2-meter span, managing thermal expansion and achieving consistent heating across four independent 0.6m x 0.6m bed segments, and implementing reliable bed leveling with an IR sensor over such a large area were critical hurdles. Wiring management for the extensive electronics, including the toolboard and multiple bed heaters with their own PSU and relay system, required meticulous planning. Firmware configuration for sensorless homing, the Duet Mini 5, and coordinating with the Raspberry Pi also demanded significant troubleshooting and fine-tuning. [Add any other specific challenges and how you solved them, e.g., belt tensioning, motion system calibration, material handling for large prints].
